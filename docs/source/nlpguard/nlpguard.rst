NLPGuard
========

NLPGuard is a powerful library for annotating and identifying protected attributes in text data. It consists of three main components: **Explainer**, **Identifier**, and **Moderator**.

This document provides an overview of these components and their role in improving fairness and interpretability in NLP models.

Explainer
=========

The **Explainer** component, part of the `nlpguard` library, extracts the most important predictive words used by the classifier to make predictions.

Overview
--------

The **Explainer** identifies influential features contributing to the model's decisions, enabling users to interpret and debug the behavior of NLP models.

- :doc:`API Documentation <explainer/api>`


Identifier
==========

The **Identifier** component, part of the `nlpguard` library, determines which of the words extracted by the **Explainer** are protected attributes.

Overview
--------

The **Identifier** flags features or attributes that are sensitive or protected, such as those related to race, gender, or age, ensuring that potential bias in models can be addressed.

- :doc:`API Documentation <identifier/api>`


Moderator
=========

The **Moderator** component, part of the `nlpguard` library, modifies the original training dataset to produce a new mitigated version that reduces reliance on protected attributes.

Overview
--------

The **Moderator** helps ensure fairness by mitigating the modelâ€™s dependency on sensitive features identified by the **Identifier**.
